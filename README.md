Test Cases Standards

Steps for Creating Test Cases:
1. Understand the Requirements:

2. Review the software requirements, user stories, and specifications.
Identify the functional and non-functional requirements.
Define the Scope of Testing:

3. Determine which parts of the system need testing.
Prioritize test cases based on critical business functions, complexity, or risk.
Identify Test Scenarios:

4. Break down the requirements into scenarios that capture different paths and conditions.
Ensure scenarios cover positive, negative, edge, and boundary cases.
Write Test Case Titles:

5. Title each test case clearly, describing the function or area it covers.
Define Pre-Conditions:

6. List any conditions that must be met before executing the test (e.g., login must be successful).
Write Test Steps:

7. Detail the step-by-step actions required to execute the test.
Ensure the steps are simple, clear, and reproducible.
Specify Test Data:

8. Identify any required inputs or data needed for the test (e.g., sample usernames or product codes).
Use valid, invalid, boundary, and extreme data as per the scenario.
Define Expected Results:

9. For each step, describe what should happen if the application is working as expected.
Clearly state the output for both successful and failed test cases.
Add Post-Conditions (if necessary):

10. List any actions that should be done after the test case execution, such as resetting the system state.
Assign Test Case ID:

11. Use a standard naming convention for the test case ID to make tracking easier (e.g., TC_Login_001 for login tests).
Review & Validate:

12. Review the test cases with peers or stakeholders to ensure accuracy and coverage.
Execute and Log Results:

13. Execute the test cases during testing phases and log the outcomes for each step.
Standards for Writing Test Cases:

################################################################################################################################################################

- Standards for Writing Test Cases:
1. Clarity and Simplicity: Test cases should be written in simple, non-technical language, making them understandable for all team members.
2. Traceability: Every test case should be linked back to specific requirements (traceability matrix), ensuring that all functionalities are covered.
3. Modularity: Test cases should be independent, allowing them to be reused in different test cycles without modification.
4. Measurable and Verifiable: The expected outcome should be clearly measurable and verifiable, ensuring itâ€™s easy to mark a test case as pass or fail.
5. Maintenance: Keep test cases up-to-date with evolving software requirements and changes in functionality.
6. Positive and Negative Testing: Ensure the test cases include both positive testing (valid inputs) and negative testing (invalid inputs).
7. Use of Standard Template: Adopt a consistent template that includes fields such as test case ID, test title, preconditions, steps, expected results, and status.
